Hello, welcome to my calculator!

This is my last project to complete the Foundations course on TOP (The Odin Project).
In order to make this, it was needed all of my JavaScript knowledge that I learned throughout the course, and some HTML and CSS too
(that part was easy, but coding was pretty hard to me). It took me something around 8 hours of code, but I know that time will shrink
the more I practice and grow as a web developer.

HINT: the "console.log"s are there to understand what is happening behind, like key toggle between num1 and num2, if want to see it,
      just removes the "//".
